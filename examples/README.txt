aqmbc Examples
==============

Each of the examples below uses a minimum working example. Each example was first tested on the original files from the source model. Afterwards, the input files were subset to make the inputs easy to distribute.

* Only ozone and sulfate aerosol were retained,
* lon/lat was subset to just conver the continental US, and
* the grid was thinned to 3x3 (corners and midpoints).

Feel free to skip ahead and run the examples. The :doc:`../modifyexamples` section describes in detail how to update an example for a real application.
