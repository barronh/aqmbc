aqmbc Examples
==============

Each of the examples below uses a minimum working example. Each example was first tested on the original files from the source model. Afterwards, the input files were subset to make the inputs easy to distribute.

* Only ozone and sulfate aerosol were retained,
* lon/lat was subset to just conver the continental US, and
* the grid was thinned to 3x3 (corners and midpoints).

The examples assume that you have installed aqmbc:

.. code-block::

    pip install git+https://github.com/barronh/aqmbc.git


After that, you can copy or download the code to run it.

When you are comfortable running the examples, read the :doc:`../modifyexamples` section. That describes in detail how to update an example for real-world application. If something is unclear, feel free to open an `issue <https://github.com/barronh/aqmbc/issues>`_.
