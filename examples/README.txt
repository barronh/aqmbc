aqmbc Examples
==============

Each of the examples below uses a minimum working example. Each example was first tested on the original files from the source model. Afterwards, the input files were subset to make the inputs easy to distribute.

* Only ozone and sulfate aerosol were retained,
* lon/lat was subset to just conver the continental US, and
* the grid was thinned to 3x3 (corners and midpoints).

The minimum working examples can be updated to be full applications easily. Each example is designed so that, if its inputs are not available, it will download the original "full" files. The only other change is to replace the expression files (currently only using ozone and sulfate) with a more comprehensive set.
